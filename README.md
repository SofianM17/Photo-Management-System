# Photo Management System

## What Is It?
This Photo Management System was developed collaboratively in a team of 4 using WPF with a focus on GUI design and requirement elicitation from end users - photographers in this case. This application allows the user to:
- Register
- Upload and delete uploaded photos 
- Name, describe, and price photos
- Create albums from uploaded photos, and delete them
- Upload and download pdf files for invoice management

This is a conceptual app for demonstrating user-focused interface design that uses local storage.

## How to Run
To run the GUI application, execute \Studio4\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\studio4.exe
